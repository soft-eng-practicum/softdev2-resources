<h3 id="agile-principles-lead-to-teamwork">Agile Principles lead to Teamwork</h3>
<p><strong>The agile process molds to the needs of the people and team</strong></p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>4. Work Together.</strong> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project (one team).</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>5. Empower &amp; Trust.</strong> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>6. Face to Face Conversations.</strong> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face–to–face conversation.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>11. Self-organizing Teams.</strong> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self–organizing teams.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>12. Reflect &amp; Adjust.</strong> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="scrum-team-1">Scrum Team</h3>
<p>Scrum Team includes three roles: <strong>Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team</strong>.</p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p>The <strong>Scrum Master</strong> helps the Scrum Team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. Scrum Masters hold the Scrum Team accountable to their working agreements, Scrum values, and to the Scrum framework itself.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p>The <strong>Product Owner</strong> defines the what&ndash;as in what the product will look like and what features it should contain. Product Owner helps build and clarify the product backlog and ensures that everyone knows the priorities.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '

  <p>The <strong>Development Team</strong> decides how to accomplish the work set forth by the Product Owner. Development Teams are structured and empowered to organize and manage their own work.</p>

<h3 id="our-scrum-team">Our Scrum Team</h3>
<p>Our Scrum Team includes three roles:</p>
<p>

<span class='fragment '

  <strong>Scrum Master/ Project Manager</strong>
</span> 

<span class='fragment '

  <strong>Product Owner/ Client</strong>
</span> 

<span class='fragment '
  >
  In our classroom setting, the <strong>Product Owner</strong> role is assigned to the <strong>Client</strong>. Note that in our class setting, Product Owner does not necessarily means that the person owns the product. Students must look at the project history and check with the instructor to find out the real owner of the project. Usually, there are several parts included.
</span></p>
<p>

<span class='fragment '
  >
  <strong>Development Team</strong>
</span>


<span class='fragment '

  In our classroom setting, each person in the team has the role of <strong>code developer</strong>. In addition, each team member has one or two more roles of the following:  lead programmer, UI design, data modeler, client liason, documentation lead, test lead, project manager.
