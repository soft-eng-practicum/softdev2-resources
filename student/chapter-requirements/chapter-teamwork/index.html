<h3 id="agile-principles-lead-to-teamwork">Agile Principles lead to Teamwork</h3>
<p><strong>The agile process molds to the needs of the people and team</strong></p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>4. Work Together.</strong> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project (one team).</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>5. Empower &amp; Trust.</strong> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>6. Face to Face Conversations.</strong> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face–to–face conversation.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>11. Self-organizing Teams.</strong> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self–organizing teams.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>12. Reflect &amp; Adjust.</strong> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</p>

<p>Scrum Team includes three roles: <strong>Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team</strong>.</p>


<span class='fragment '

  <p>The <strong>Scrum Master</strong> helps the Scrum Team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. Scrum Masters hold the Scrum Team accountable to their working agreements, Scrum values, and to the Scrum framework itself.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '

  <p>The <strong>Product Owner</strong> defines the what&ndash;as in what the product will look like and what features it should contain. Product Owner helps build and clarify the product backlog and ensures that everyone knows the priorities.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '

  In our classroom setting, the <strong>Product Owner</strong> role is assigned to the <strong>Client</strong>. Note that in our class setting, Product Owner does not necessarily means that the person owns the product.

</span></p>
<p>

<span class='fragment '

  <strong>Development Team</strong>
</span>
