#### Types of Software Licenses

1. **Freeware, open-source** <br/> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"> Freeware is for software aimed to be distributed freely; and open source also provides the source code. These types of licenses can cause viral distribution and modification. Many popular frameworks and platforms use this model. It also allows public scrutiny against possible weaknesses.</span>
1. **Closed-source, proprietary** <br/> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> 
  <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Commercial entities working with clients usually select to hide and protect software for competitive reasons. Hidden weaknesses in the code may take a while to find and when they are exposed, can be difficult to fix.</span>

#### How to Select a License for Your Project

1. For **open source** licenses, see
   [list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses). A
   common and easy method is to use the
   [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/).
2. For **proprietary** licenses, there are
   [many types](https://ggc-sd.github.io/LegalSoftDevApps/paper_ch4.html). There
   are also license generators such as [BinPress](https://www.binpress.com/license-generator/).
