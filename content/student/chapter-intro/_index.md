## Welcome

- What's better than to start the semester with a **quiz**?

{{% fragment %}}
Logistics heads-up:

- Using Reddit/Piazza for forum discussion and Q&A support
- Sections 1 & 2 are separate, but follow same content
- Using Discord and Github organizations with previous members
- Everything online this semester, will meet on live video on Discord

Meaning:

- Bigger community, can see what others are doing
- Can see results of their research, answers to questions
- Can even collaborate with projects?
- Any problems, potential issues?

### Tool/article presentations

Throughout semester I'll let you research topics so we all learn more about options out there:

- Each student will pick one item in any of the topics by a given deadline
- You will give a presentation in class and post your summary
- After everyone presents for one topic, we discuss in class

Topics will be posted later, but will include:

- **Tools:** Web frameworks (MEAN, .Net, JSP/JSF, PHP, …), Frontend frameworks (jQuery, Bootstrap, …), IDEs, Version control software (git, mercurial, …) and online portals (Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, …), Project tracking tools (JIRA, Trello, Pivotal Tracker, Rally, Version One, …), Database engines (MySQL, PostGreSQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle, …)
