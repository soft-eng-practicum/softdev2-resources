This site contains a collection of lectures, assignments, and instructor materials for teaching software engineering or development, at an _intermediate_ level. It is assumed that students already know basic software engineering terms and skills. 

Materials are used for the [ITEC 3870 Software Development II course](https://soft-eng-practicum.github.io/) taught at [Georgia Gwinnett College](https://ggc.edu). They were developed by [Cengiz Gunay](https://www.ggc.edu/about-ggc/directory/cengiz-gunay) and [Anca Doloc-Mihu](https://www.ggc.edu/about-ggc/directory/anca-doloc-mihu), supported by an [Affordable Learning Georgia](https://www.affordablelearninggeorgia.org/) grant in 2019-2020.

Some materials are courtesy of Joan Smith, Eugene Agichstein, and the Internets. Slides are offered with the license: [CC BY-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

To modify and use these materials in your classes, fork the [Github repository]({{< param github_repository >}}) or use the edit link at the bottom right of each page.
