### Our Scrum Team

Our Scrum Team includes three roles:

{{% fragment %}} **Scrum Master/ Project Manager** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} In our classroom setting, the **Scrum Master** role is assigned to the **Project Manager** (PM). {{% /fragment %}}

{{% fragment %}} **Development Team** {{% /fragment %}}
{{% fragment %}} In our classroom setting, each person in the team has the role of **code developer**. In addition, each team member has one or two more roles of the following:  lead programmer, UI design, data modeler, client liason, documentation lead, test lead, project manager. {{% /fragment %}}
