<p><strong>Scrum: An [agile] framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.</strong></p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  Scrum refers to a lightweight framework that is used in every industry to deliver complex, innovative products and services that truly delight customers. It is <strong>simple to understand, but difficult to master</strong>.
</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p>Scrum fulfils the vision of the Agile Manifesto by helping individuals and businesses organize their work to</p>
<ul>
<li>maximize collaboration,</li>
<li>minimize errors,</li>
<li>deliver frequently, and</li>
<li>create multiple opportunities to inspect and adapt.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-scrum-works">How Scrum works</h3>
<p><strong>Scrum works by delivering large projects in small chunks of the product that a team can begin and complete in one, short timeboxed iteration called sprint.</strong></p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  Scrum is also both <strong>iterative</strong> and <strong>incremental</strong>.
</span>
</section><section>
<h3 id="scrum-framework">Scrum Framework</h3>
<p><strong>People are the focus of Scrum.</strong></p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <strong>Scrum Teams</strong> include people with diverse skillsets; each team has all of the capabilities necessary to deliver a piece of functionality from idea to delivery.
</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>Sprint</strong> is a short (one to four weeks long) timeframe during which the team works on some chunks of the product.</p>

</span>
</section><section>
<h3 id="scrum-team">Scrum Team</h3>
<p>Scrum Team includes three roles: <strong>Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team</strong>.</p>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p>The <strong>Scrum Master</strong> helps the Scrum Team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. Scrum Masters hold the Scrum Team accountable to their working agreements, Scrum values, and to the Scrum framework itself.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p>The <strong>Product Owner</strong> defines the what&ndash;as in what the product will look like and what features it should contain. Product Owner helps build and clarify the product backlog and ensures that everyone knows the priorities.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p>The <strong>Development Team</strong> decides how to accomplish the work set forth by the Product Owner. Development Teams are structured and empowered to organize and manage their own work.</p>

  <p><strong>Sprint</strong> is a short (one to four weeks long) timeframe during which the team works on some chunks of the product.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '

  <ul>
<li>Each sprint begins with a plan followed by building and then testing the code, and ends with a review of the work completed and an additional review of the way in which the team worked together (retrospectives).</li>
</ul>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <ul>
<li>During each sprint, the team completes one or more increments of the project. Each completed increment must be fully tested and fully approved by the end of the sprint (potentially deliverable).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="scrum-values">Scrum Values</h3>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>Commitment</strong>: Scrum teams work together as a unit, members trust each other to follow through on what they say they are going to do.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>Courage</strong>: Scrum teams must feel safe enough to say no, to ask for help, and to try new things.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>Focus</strong>: It means that whatever Scrum teams start they finish.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>Openness</strong>: Scrum teams consistently seek out new ideas and opportunities to learn.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p><strong>Respect</strong>: Scrum team members respect each other’s ideas, give each other permission to have a bad day once in a while, and recognize each other’s accomplishments. They show respect to one another, to the product owner, to stakeholders, and to the ScrumMaster.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Product Backlog</strong> is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in a product.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p>The <strong>Sprint Backlog</strong> is a list of everything that the team commits to achieve in a given Sprint. Once created, no one can add to the Sprint Backlog except the Development Team. If an item needs to be dropped from the Sprint Backlog, they must negotiate it with the Product Owner.</p>

</span>


<span class='fragment '
  >
  <p>At the end of every Sprint, the team must complete a <strong>potentially releasable product increment</strong> meaning that it is done as agreed upon.</p>

<h3 id="tracking-progress">Tracking Progress</h3>
<p><strong>Burndown Chart</strong> Sprint burndowns are a graphical way of showing how much work is remaining in the sprint, typically in terms of task hours.
As the work progresses, the amount of work remaining should steadily decrease and should trend toward being complete on the last day of the sprint.</p>
