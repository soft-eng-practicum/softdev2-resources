{{% fragment %}} 

- Who determines the ownership of IP?
  - Based on contract, company may own
  - In group work, an signed agreement needs to be made
  - Easiest in class projects is to divide IP equally among members, but up to members to agree

#### Why is it Important to Establish IP?

- Many creative projects come out of class
- Most will never become commercialized
- But some may have merit
- If any of you would like to take it further in the future, and money is involved, the division of credit becomes very difficult
- Best to decide as you finalize your project this semester
- Submit an IP agreement that determines contributions between team, your client, and your professor.
