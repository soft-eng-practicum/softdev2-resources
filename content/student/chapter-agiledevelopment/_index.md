### Manifesto for Agile Software Development 

**"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:**

* <font color="blue"> Individuals and interactions </font> over processes and tools 
* <font color="blue"> Working software </font> over comprehensive documentation 
* <font color="blue"> Customer collaboration </font> over contract negotiation 
* <font color="blue"> Responding to change </font> over following a plan 

**That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.”**


[Kent Beck et al](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
