## What are Angular Components?

Angular Components can be describe as a the most basic building blocks of an Angular application. In simple technical terms a component is just controller for the user interface.

{{% fragment %}}
#### A component is made of

-HTML template that declares what is viewed on the page
-Typescript files that give it behavior just like methods do to a class in java
-CSS selector that defines how it is used in the view page

## Let's create an Angular Project to demo Components

In order to create Angular project we must first have Node installed in our system. You can download Node from [here] (https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once Node is installed the next step is to open the terminal and run the next commands to install and create our Angular application.
```sh
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```

The previous command installed Angular the next command is to create a Project and give it a name. I will use ComponentsDemo for demostration you can use what ever you like.
```sh
$ ng new ComponentsDemo
```
The next command is to run and open our application
```sh
$ cd ComponentsDemo
ng serve --open
```

---

## Accessing our Project

In order to edit and modify our Angular Components application we are going to use Visual Studio Code. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

We can open our project in Visual code using the following command in the Terminal.
```sh
$ code .
```

---

## Creating our Components

There are two way to create Components in Angular manually and using the Angular CLI

{{% fragment %}}
The best way according to the Angular docs forms it to create components using the Angular CLI, Which is what we are going to do next.

From the terminal we need to go to our Angular application first once on it we will run the following command.
```sh
$ ng generate component <component name>
```
FIY <component name> shoud be replace by the name of your component.

## First Container

First we'll create and run an Ubuntu container:

```sh
$ docker run -it --rm ubuntu bash
```
where
- `-it` is short for `--interactive --tty` which starts the container in interactive mode and lets you enter text via the terminal
- `--rm` deletes the container after it exits (but not the image)
- `ubuntu` is the name of the image
- `bash` is the command executed when the container starts<br>
(technically bash is already the default entrypoint for the Ubuntu image and is only used here to showcase the [COMMAND] argument)

---

## First Container

If this is your first time using the Ubuntu image Docker will first download it from Docker Hub. If everything has gone according to plan, you should see a new prompt similar to
```sh
root@a5d9a7a5232c:/#
```

where
- `root` is the current user
- `a5d9a7a5232c` is the hostname (randomly generated by Docker)
- `/` is your current working directory (root directory in this case)
- `#` is another indication that you're logged in as root (non root users have a `$`)

**Note:** In documentation, it is common to use a single dollar sign `$` prompt (instead of something like `root@a5d9a7a5232c:/#`) for simplicity, especially when the information conveyed in a longer prompt isn't relevant to the concepts at hand.

---

## First Container

You can try running commands like `ls` to list files and folders:
```sh
$ ls
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  ...  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

or `ps aux` to list running processes:
```sh
$ ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  1.0  0.1   4112  3492 pts/0    Ss   17:13   0:00 /bin/bash
root        10  0.0  0.1   5900  3024 pts/0    R+   17:13   0:00 ps aux
```

**Note:** If this were a virtual machine, you would see tens, possibly hundreds of running processes instead of a small list of isolated ones.

---

## First Container

You can also try factoring very large numbers:
```txt
$ factor 12345678901010101010101010987654321
12345678901010101010101010987654321: 19 853 32069 398053 465067 128312953569637
```

or:
```sh
$ yes Dr. Gunay is awesome
Dr. Gunay is awesome
Dr. Gunay is awesome
Dr. Gunay is awesome
Dr. Gunay is awesome
...
```

---

## First Container

To quit, run the command `exit`. Since `bash` (PID 1) was the initial process used to start the container, once it exits, the container stops.

Because we used the `--rm` option, Docker should delete the container once it exits which you can verify by typing
```sh
$ docker container ls -a
```
however the Ubuntu image should still be saved locally:
```txt
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY        TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
ubuntu            latest        f63181f19b2f   12 days ago   72.9MB
```

---

## Running Python

As another example, you can also try running Python instead of bash:
```txt
$ docker run -it --rm python:slim

Python 3.9.1 (default, Jan 12 2021, 16:56:42)
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> a = 5
>>> print(a + 2)
7

>>> exit()
```

---

## Running Python 2.7

You can also create containers for different versions of Python:
```txt
$ docker run -it --rm python:2.7-slim

Python 2.7.18 (default, Jan 12 2021, 16:56:42)
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> a = 5
>>> print a+2
7

>>> exit()
```

---

## Dockerfiles

Say you'd like to slightly customize an image available on Docker Hub. If you're trying to run a Python application you could start off with the image `python:slim`, add your application and install any dependencies to create an image specific to your app. This is done using a Dockerfile.

{{% fragment %}}
A Dockerfile is just a text file containing a list of commands used to build an image. The default filename is just `Dockerfile`. Dockerfiles must begin with a `FROM` instruction which specifies a parent image, such as `python:3.9` or `node:15.7`.
{{% /fragment %}}

---

## Common Dockerfile Commands

* `COPY <src> <dest>`\
Copies files on the host at `<src>` to the container at the path `<dest>`

* `RUN <command>`\
Executes the command once inside the image

* `ENV <key>=<value>`\
Sets the environment variable `<key>` to `<value>`

* `ENTRYPOINT <command>`\
Executes `<command>` whenever the container starts

You can read more about all the different commands [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

---

## Python Dockerfile

Create the file `hello.py` somewhere on your computer with the following lines:
```py
import os

name = input('What is your name? ')
print(f'Hello {name}!')

print(os.environ.get('GOODBYE'))
```

{{% fragment %}}
But what if you don't have Python installed? That's perfectly fine! With Docker you can download a Python image to run the code without actually installing Python on your host computer.
{{% /fragment %}}

---

## Python Dockerfile

In the same folder as `hello.py`, create the file `Dockerfile` and add:
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

ENV GOODBYE=adios

# You can also add comments :0
COPY hello.py .

ENTRYPOINT python hello.py
```

{{% fragment %}}
Once you've saved the file, open a command prompt in that directory and run
```sh
$ docker build -t hello .
```
which builds the image and tags it with the name `hello`. You should be able to see the image by typing
```txt
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY        TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
hello             latest        50b4f80bd32a   13 seconds ago   114MB
```
{{% /fragment %}}

---

## Running Your Image

Use the following command to run your image:
```txt
$ docker run -it --rm hello
What is your name? bob
Hello bob!
adios
```

After entering your name, the container should print a greeting, a closing, and then exit. Because of the ` --rm` option, the container should be deleted.

## How Docker Works

On Linux, Docker utilizes two technologies of the Linux kernel to achieve this containerization:
- [Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces) are used to isolate kernel resources such as mounted file systems, hostnames, process IDs, and user IDs. A single container will have a namespace for each of these resources.

- [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) (control groups) are used to isolate system resources such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and networking.

Click the down arrow for more information!

---

## How Docker Works

Essentially, whenever a process tries to access kernel resources, the kernel uses the process's allocated namespace to determine which resource to provide.

For example, in a container's PID namespace Apache might be running with process ID 1, but it might have process ID 650 in the initial ("root") PID namespace that was created when the computer started. From the root PID namespace's perspective, Apache is just another process along with all the other processes running on the operating system, however from Apache's perspective, it looks like it's running alone with possibly a few additional processes used in the container.

---

## How Docker Works

Other resources can also be containerized in this way. In one container the path `/bin/bash` could point to the Bourne Again Shell executable while in another container the file might not exist. This determination is made at the kernel level and completely transparent to the processes running inside the container.

While a technical understanding of the technologies mentioned above isn't necessary to effectively use Docker, it often helps in understanding the "why" component. For details on how containers can be implemented, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc) where a simple version of Docker is written using Go.
